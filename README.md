# Functionality

## Docker Container

### Configured from SSM Parameters

The standard [Kong docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/kong/) takes configuration from environment variables. Deploying this would tie Kong's configuration to the task definition which has two main disadvantages:

- Configuration updates require deploying new task definition
- Secrets must be stored in task definition
- No canonical secret/config store

For these reasons it was decided to extend the standard Kong 0.14.0-alpine image to optionally take its config from SSM parameters.

This was done by installing awscli, jq and curl in the image, and modifying docker-entrypoint.sh to use these to (if provided) obtain the config and override Kong's default environment variables.

The SSM parameter names are passed in as environment variables at 'docker run' time i.e. container definition (see main.tf resource "aws_ecs_task_definition"). By default these are all SecureStrings nested under prefix "/dev/kong/"

The parameters are set at terraform apply-time - see main.tf e.g. resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "db_username"

### Permissions

This setup also requires that the running container (task) have permission to read and decrypt the SSM Parameters.

This is done using AWS' "task_role" concept, which assigns an IAM role to the task by passing in environment variable "AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI", which is used to obtain assumed role for the container.

Such approach means the container instance itself, nor any other container tasks running on same instance, can access these secrets.

This IAM work took quite some time to debug; had to modify entrypoint/command in deployed task definition, to just e.g. "/usr/bin/env", or "/usr/bin/aws ssm get-parameter ..", then ssh to the docker host/container instance and view logs (or via cloudwatch, but that's slower)

The IAM role is created by custom module in modules/ecs_task_iam/main.tf

This module takes variables from the rest of the config (changing e.g. prefix/ssm parameter name in toplevel variables.tf will also update IAM policy as you might hope :), and outputs the task ARN for the task definition to use.

### Registry & Source

The container is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rdkls/kong_ssm/), and the source on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/nick_doyle/docker_kong_ssm/)


## Done

- VPC
    - Subnets public & private in 3AZs
- SGs for
    - Kong app (on ecs)
    - RDS, inbound only from public subnet (issues getting TF to do by SG)
- IAM roles for
    - ECS instance
    - ECS service (the running containers themselves, with only SSM read)
- ECS Cluster
    - ASG & LC
    - ECS Instances restricted according to best prac - no privileged containers & no metadata from containers
- ECS Service for Kong
    - TODO rds access
- RDS (postgres)
- SSM Parameter Store
    - Storing config/secrets (as SecureString)

## To Do

- Kong access RDS (currently container just constantly restarts)
- Load Balancer
- Bastion for Kong Admin

# Usage

Per standard Terraform best prac - creds expected to be in environment OR instance profile

e.g. my dev instance has IAM profile "provisioner" which runs this

The only var not specified in variables.tf is the database pasword:

`terraform apply -var 'db_password=myawesomepassword'`

(or leaving it blank will just prompt)

# Dependencies

Most terraform modules added as git submodules, cribbed from Terraform community AWS modules: https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/

After cloning this, you will need to `git submodule init && git submodule update` to get them
